**What did you do this past week?**  
As with every other week that a phase of the project was due, this past week was a busy one. My team and I spent a lot of time in the lab working on phase 3. We also found that we have a love-hate relationship with MongoDB. It provides text indexes, making the basic search functionality of phase 3 pretty trivial to implement, but it has no support for retrieving the blurb that the search result matched with. Similarly, MongoDB text indexes don't support regex, so searching 'blood' won't retrieve 'The Bloodthirster' as a search result. So while MongoDB did make some things easy, it also ended up forcing us to do other things in an inefficient or roundabout way. 

**What's in your way?**
