Software Engineering was overall a very worthwhile class to have taken. Professor Downing cold calls people in class, so it's a sort of pressure to constantly pay attention. While it sounds scary, it's not actually that bad. In fact, I'd say that it helped me learn the material better. The projects gave a taste of what full stack development was like. The tools we used were frustrating at times, but also valuable learning experiences. This class is not a blow-off class; expect to put in a lot of time and effort if you want to do well. However, if you do decide to stick with it, you'll be glad you did. Professor Downing's Software Engineering class is definitely one of the better classes I've taken at UT.
