Software Engineering was overall a very worthwhile class to have. The structure of the class makes it so that you can't easily get by without actually paying attention in class. The projects gave a taste of what full stack development was like. The tools we used were frustrating at times, but also valuable learning experiences more often than not. This class is not particularly easy; expect to put in a lot of time and effort if you want to do well. However, if you do decide to stick with it, you'll be glad you did. Professor Downing's Software Engineering class is definitely one of the better classes I've taken.
